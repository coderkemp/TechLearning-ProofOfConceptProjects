                                       REQUIREMENT

As we all know Tyler is moving to AWS and we have already started doing that with the efforts of First Student and Ride360.  We also had the training from AWS during annual meeting week to get people in the cloud platform and want to keep that trend going.
 
If you haven't figured out, the "Patty's here" and "9 Miles" announcements are no longer sent by Kim.  Well, they are from her account, but she doesn't type them!
 
We put a small AWS IOT button in the plaza that will automatically send an email/teams message based on the number of times you press it.  It looks something like this.
 


 

After a little setup to our account and about 85 lines of code, it can do a whole list of things!

 

This is where the possibility for fun comes in... We have an extra one that we don't know what to do with.  We want to open this up to have people in development come up with ideas and have the ability to program it!

 

How the button works...

 - It connects to the internet and our AWS account via Wi-Fi and is setup on the Tyler network

 - Has 3 default "triggers" you can code against

    - Single Tap

    - Double Tap

    - Long Press (3 seconds)

 

How the challenge will work...

 - The button has to help either an office or a department within Tyler

 - It's up to you to write the code! 

    - We understand not everyone in development can code, so feel free to pair up!  You can write in any language that AWS Lambda supports (Python, Node, dotnet, even powershell!)

 - Ideas/code to be submitted by March 13th

    - Submission should include your name (and name of people on the team if a team), brief summary of the idea, and the code! (since the code will most likely be small, can be a bitbucket link or zip file)

    - Submissions should be sent to myself via teams

 

The winner...

 - Will be decided by a team (TBD) shortly after submissions

 - Idea will be used in the office and the button will be setup

 - Winner/team will get a $100 Amazon Gift Card
