PURPOSE:
   In the Development floor, we frequently find emails in our inbox with respect to a team member bringing up donuts, pastries on reasons
   like birthdays, sometimes just out of generosity & some times we need a common place to gather the entire dev crowd to one place.
   IoT button fits well to this requirement.
   
GOAL:
   My Idea Supports:
    1. On Single click of the IoT button, send a Birthday mail( I know the surprise lies in figuring out who's birthday)
    2. On Double click, No reason generic email for pastries
    3. On long-click, in case of any emergencies/to assemble everyone in a common place.
    4. Further, I am storing the message based on the type of click in a dynamo-db table -> probably may be for some kind of data analysis.
       For example: Let's say over a year of usage, we know what season of the year we have many birthdays & can we plan some fun event
       based on it?
       What season of the year did we encounter long clicks signifying an emergency/announcement so we could may be get an general idea for
       future?
       
Technologies:
So I Implemented the above using JS,
1. Code : Pastries_Button.js - 
2. Created a SNS topic, have added my email as of now but probable I think VST-Development@tylertech.com can be added later.
3. Lambda function with the code from my Pastries_Button.js button.
4. Dynamo db table named 'DevTreatsTable' which stores the messages based on clicks.
